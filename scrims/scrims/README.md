## Lunar V2
Lunar V2 on the other hand, has 25+ customizable settings, UI, improved accuracy, and support for YoloV5, YoloV7, & YoloV8.

## About

Lunar can be modified to work with a variety of FPS games; however, it is currently configured for Fortnite. Besides being general purpose, the main advantage of using Lunar is that it does not meddle with the memory of other processes.

Lunar LITE uses [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
